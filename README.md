# auto_unsplash

### automatic import unsplash free image to system
We usually use faker as demo data, but faker image just return a image folder, when refresh , the image will change, and also one page will get all same image.

So we use unslash free image as the demo data, but if manually copy files, it will take a long time, this is why create a auto. 

using axios promise bases http client and auto submit to loop to the next page
